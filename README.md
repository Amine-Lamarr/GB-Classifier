<h1>Heart Attack Risk Classification with Gradient Boosting</h1>
This project uses machine learning (specifically, Gradient Boosting Classifier) to predict the risk level of a heart attack based on several medical features.

<h1>What This Project Does</h1>

Loads and explores the dataset.

Handles non-numeric data and missing values.

Removes outliers to improve model performance.

Scales features using StandardScaler.

Splits the data into training and testing sets.

Performs hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix.

Visualizes feature importance and learning curves.
